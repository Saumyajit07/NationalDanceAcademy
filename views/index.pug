                    p Dance is an art form where the body moves rhythmically, usually to the beat of the music. A simple movement such as walking, clapping in a pattern, to a particular rhythm, can be termed as dance. Dance allows you to express your emotions and communicate with the rest of the world.

                    p Dance can be taken as a profession or a hobby by some. However, to become a professional dancer you’ll need a few years of practice. The toughest part of learning dance is keeping up with the rhythm. So you’ll have to find the right teacher who can help you improve the areas you find difficult while dancing.
